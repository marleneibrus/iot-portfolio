# Module 1

Module description:
In this module, you will have an overview of the course structure. It will also introduce you to the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) through videos and live demos. In-class discussions will be held about basic concepts of IoT and where it can be applied in the world. Finally, we will have a hands-on experience with the technology through our master class. 

## Task Inspirations

- The video pointed out a lot of very interesting projects that could be implemented, especially in the field of healthcare and agriculture.
- The IoT field has a lot of cheap devices and open source projects that enable DIY and experimentation.

## Task Personal Profile

## Task What is IoT
IoT enables smart devices to communicate with each other and with other internet-enabled devices(create a system of devices). Like smartphones and gateways, creating a vast network of interconnected devices that can exchange data and perform various tasks autonomously.
