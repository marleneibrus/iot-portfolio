# Module 1

Module description:
In this module, you will have an overview of the course structure. It will also introduce you to the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) through videos and live demos. In-class discussions will be held about basic concepts of IoT and where it can be applied in the world. Finally, we will have a hands-on experience with the technology through our master class. 

## Task Inspirations

- The video pointed out a lot of very interesting projects that could be implemented, especially in the field of healthcare and agriculture.
- The IoT field has a lot of cheap devices and open source projects that enable DIY and experimentation.

## Task Personal Profile
My name is **Marlene Ibrus** and I am a third year Bachelor's Computer Science student. I have no significant prior experience with IoT, but I hope to lear a lot from this course. I got interested in this topic mainly due to the IOT's usefulness for industrial automation. <br>
My expectations for this course are the following:
- Learning how to design and develop IoT systems.
- Gaining hands-on experience with IoT devices and platforms.
- Working on real-world IoT applications and projects.

## Task What is IoT
IoT enables smart devices to communicate with each other and with other internet-enabled devices(create a system of devices). Like smartphones and gateways, creating a vast network of interconnected devices that can exchange data and perform various tasks autonomously.

Domains and included areas:

- Healthcare: monitoring patients remotely
- Retail: tracking customer behaviour
- Agriculture: monitoring soil data


Commonly used (data) protocols:

- Advanced Message Queuing Protocol **AMQP**
- Cellular
- WIFI
- Bluetooth

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

- Smart home devices
- Smart watches
- M5 Stick (master class)
- Dallas temperature sensor (master class)

Challenges:

- Connecting the dallas temperature probe to the M5 stick
- Displaying a graph of temperature measures
