This week, we attempted to set up IoTempower nodes as part of our hands-on work for this module. Despite our best efforts, we encountered several challenges, most notably, the lack of a stable internet connection, which turned out to be a major roadblock in getting the system up and running. Thankfully, we received a great deal of help from Uli, whose guidance was invaluable as we tried to troubleshoot the issues.
