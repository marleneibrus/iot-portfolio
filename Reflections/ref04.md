# Reflection 1 in Module 3

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  Generally, this week was all about setting up communication between devices using the Mango router and MQTT. One key takeaway is how important it is to check network configurationsâ€”something as simple as my laptop defaulting to IPv6 caused unexpected delays. I also want to remember how to properly configure OpenWRT and MQTT, as it was useful but took some troubleshooting.
- What was good?
  I really liked the demo this week, it helped to rewise networking, althoughI do feel like I should do sme additional revision. 
- What was difficult, where did you struggle?
- Unfortunately I was quite sick this week and I could not take part in the mini project as much as I would have liked:( Otherwise the session was nice. Also, as I had to leave early, I cannot comment on things related to the miniproject, as my partner did it.
