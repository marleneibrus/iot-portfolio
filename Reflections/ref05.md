# Reflection 2 in Module 3

We mostly set up the laptop and router we were given. Manjaro was already installed, so we focused on setting up IoT Empire and adding some extra functionality to the router. We tried to enable internet access through USB tethering with our phones but we ran into issues — the router wouldn’t recognize my partner's phone. I had to ask for help and get a second cable to make it work. There were also some 
frustrating moments dealing with missing or unknown packages and settings. Overall, it was a good learning experience, but networking isn’t really my strong suit.
