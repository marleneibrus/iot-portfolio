# Reflection 2 in Module 3

I mostly set up the laptop and router I was given. Manjaro was already installed, so I focused on setting up IoT Empire and adding some extra functionality to the router. I tried to enable 
internet access through USB tethering with my phone, but I ran into issues—the router wouldn’t recognize my phone. I had to ask for help and get a second cable to make it work. There were also some 
frustrating moments dealing with missing or unknown packages and settings. Overall, it was a good learning experience, but networking isn’t really my strong suit.
