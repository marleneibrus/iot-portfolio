# Reflection 2 in Module 4
During this week, I had a lot of issues setting up iotknit and using it. I pretty much just tried to follow the video tutorial for the whole lesson. It was quite messy and difficult to follow, but overall I think I kind of got the very basic setup done. I also had the router set up incorrectly, so that was one additional issue.
I did get quite a lot of help from the lab assistants, and thus it was most likely my own inability to understand it:/ Overall the topic is interesting though.
