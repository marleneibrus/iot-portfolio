# Reflection 1 in Module 4

What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice? Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
- My main take-away from this lesson is the fact that C++ is quite finicky and you can have many errors.
- Some of the errors have to be artificially induced because there are built-in protections against them.

What was good?
- I liked that the lab was in a follow-along format, this made it easier to understand and complete the tasks.
- I also enjoied the lab tutorials, they were well structured and clear.
- A bonus is the fact that we did not have to write the code from scratch:)

What was difficult, where did you struggle?
- I had some issues connecting to the network because I had incorrect credentials.
- In addition, in the OTA task I had some issues with the fact that the host was not properly configured. But I did get it fixed.
- I also did not fully understand the OTA part, have to look into it further.

Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
- I think ost of the lab was pretty standard, but I did like it a lot overall:)

How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
- Not much ierraction this time also:/

Help and extra work - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?
- I got help from Renato a couple of times,configring the code to work with our network and fixing the issues with the host for the OTA task.
