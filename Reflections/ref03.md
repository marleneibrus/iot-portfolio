# Reflection 2 in Module 2

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  This week was fairly challenging, as I had many issues setting up PlatformIO IDE on my computer. Despite these challenges me and my partner managed to complete the exercise about blinking the LED. I also got to learn about low-level buses (RS232, RS485, Modbus RTU, CAN, I2C/I3C, SPI, Onewire). Overall, due to the issues I had, I was not able to get much done.
- What was good?
  Learning about low-level buses was very interesting, since I was unfamilliar with this topic. Despite the numerous challenges, working with the wemos d1 mini was still fun.
- What was difficult, where did you struggle?
  As mentioned before, I had issues regarding PlatformIO which I could not resolve during the workshop, but we were able to get my partners computer to work.
- How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
  I enjoyed working with others to research about the CAN bus and the instructors were very helpful regarding the issues I faced.
