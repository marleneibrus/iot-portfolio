# Personal Portfolio for the IoT class <at university/school>

> When you start editing this file, remove this description.
>
> Fork this repository (or use it as template).
> Everything that you do for this class should be documented here
> as well as include documented links for the work of your peers.
> This is an artifact that you can come back to any time later to
> connect and remember this class. It might even come in handy for
> a job application where projects are more important than grades. 
> We recommend to make this portfolio private and to share it with your peers
> (initially you will have a partner, later several team or group-mates).
> You will mainly document your own work in this git repository.
> If you work on a module in a team and distribute several tasks among your peers,
> just link to your peer's task into their github repository. When linking, describe
> in one sentence what you understood that your peer did in this task.
> Your peers should respectively link back to you, so that for each one
> there is a full module description that can be assessed individually.
> 
> Make sure to follow good git etiquette in this repository.
> The only binaries that are allowed to be checked in are images
> and GIFs (small animations), exception: tables can be done as pdf
> or google sheet link but are preferred in markup.
> This means, no zip, jar, word, libre office documents or PDFs in
> should be checked into this repository.
> Documentation has to be written in markdown or restructured text.
> PDFs, google documents, or videos can be linked,
> but cannot include "personal" documentation.
> Pictures you took in class but also links to pictures or videos are welcome.
> If you have hand written notes, just add them as image
> (or process them with an AI tool into markup).
>  
> For the final project consider having its own repository, but still document
> your own work here and link to the produced artifacts in that project repository.
>
> Start with module 1: have a small log (keywords are fine, we appreciate sentences, but can read keywords quicker as you usually have to present your tasks to an instructor this is more a help for yourself than for us) and pictures from class and lab tasks in here. 
> Any code goes into git repo (needs to be linked in portfolio). If you use example codes without changes, you can also link to it.
